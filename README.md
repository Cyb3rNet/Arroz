This is a reorganised code from a previous project that I had implemented to ease data transfer from a Web site to my Highrise account.

There's still much to do for **Arroz** to become a full fledged Highrise API Library Wrapper but it could inspire someone.

## Usage

Include the file **hr.inc.php**, build your Highrise XML objects from the classes of **hr.xml.generators.inc.php** and submit them with objects built from the classes found in **hr.connection.inc.php**.

At this stage only a few XML objects can be created and submitted.

## Planned Work

I would like very much to implement this library. But developing it on my spare time might mean that I'll spread it's development over a long period of time. So we'll see how it might end. Maybe you will fork this project and make it evolve much faster.
